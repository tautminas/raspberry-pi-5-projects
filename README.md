# Raspberry Pi 5 Projects Repository

This repository contains a written guide of practical projects for the [Raspberry Pi 5 Desktop kit](https://raspberrypi.dk/en/product/raspberry-pi-5-desktop-kit/). These projects are also compatible with other versions of the Raspberry Pi, and in most cases, the Standard kit is sufficient.

The guide was created using the [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks) LaTeX editor. To compile the `.tex` files into a PDF, use your LaTeX editor of choice or run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pdflatex raspberry-pi-5-projects.tex
```
