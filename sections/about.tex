This document provides descriptions, instructions and commands for projects using a Raspberry Pi 5. Each project is inspired by a YouTube video, but this document refines and expands upon the content to offer clear guidance for those who wish to replicate the projects. The purpose of collecting this information in a single document is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Some videos lack quality or are no longer relevant. This document selects the useful ones.
\item Some videos do not provide commands in written form. By providing them here, readers can avoid needing to manually retype everything.
\item Some videos could benefit from additional suggestions or improvements. This document expands on those projects to make them more practical.
\end{itemize}

The projects in this document were created using the Raspberry Pi 5 Desktop Kit. However, in most cases, a Raspberry Pi 5 Starter Kit provides all the necessary components to follow along. Additionally, these projects are not specific to the Raspberry Pi 5 as most of them can be completed using other Raspberry Pi models as well.  

In IT, a "project" is defined as a time-bound endeavor with a unique outcome. While this definition does not fully align with how it is used in the document, it remains the closest approximation to describe the work presented here.
